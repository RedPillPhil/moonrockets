The collection consists of 13337 unique digital portraits (the ‚ÄúLiL Moon Rockets‚Äù or ‚ÄúArt‚Äù) that are hashed on the blockchain and are represented by a non-fungible token (‚ÄúNFT‚Äù) each. In addition, each NFT accumulates a utility token (‚ÄúNYR‚Äù), which serves only one purpose: To rename the NFT on  Binance Smart Chain. There are no other functionalities of the NYR token. The LiL Moon Rockets smart contract allows participants to purchase the NFT representing the digital portraits from. The NYR utility token cannot be purchased, but it can be freely accumulated by holding the NFT. The only utility of the NYR token is to change the name of the NFT on the Binance Smart Chain. The Company does not provide or intend to provide a secondary market place for the NFT or NYR. LiL Moon Rockets will provide a user interface to visualize the digital art works. After the sale of an NYR to you, the ownership of the NFT, and to the connected Art, is transferred from the  Binance Smart Chain smart contract to the purchaser and concludes the business transaction between both parties. </p><p> The Company is selling the Art via the NFT and is making the Application available to you. Before you purchase an NFT and use the UI and the  Binance Smart Chain smart contracts, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these "Terms"). </p><p> PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE MAKING A PURCHASE OF AN NFT AND/OR USING THE APP. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR PURCHASE of NFT AND USE OF THE APPLICATION, UNLESS THE COMPANY HAS EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE. THE COMPANY IS ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE NFT AND THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE APPLICATION, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING ‚ÄúI ACCEPT‚Äù BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. </p><h2>1. THE LIL MOON ROCKETS APP</h2><p> A. The LiL Moon Rockets App is a collection of 13337 unique digital portraits (stored in .png format on IPFS and scalable vector graphic on LilMoonRockets.com), each represented by a NFT. By holding a LiL Moon Rocket in your wallet, you accumulate the NYR for free, which allows you to change the name on the Binance Smart Chain. </p><p> B. The LiL Moon Rocket NFTs are sold during an initial sales period of up to 3 weeks (21 days) according to the price schedule displayed on the website (<a href>LiLMoonRockets.com</a>). All unsold rockets during the initial sales period will remain purchasable after the initial sales period has concluded as the sale is encoded in the smart contract. The Company does not provide any additional services to the user after the business transaction is concluded. </p><p> C. You can access the Appvia any web browser using the URL https://LiLMoonRockets.com and an electronic  Binance Smart Chain wallet compatible with the NFTstandard on the Binance Smart Chain network, such as the MetaMask wallet. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the App other than through MetaMask, or other  Binance Smart Chain-compatible browsers. </p><p> D. Transactions on the App are managed and confirmed via the Binance Smart Chain. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Google Chrome, the Binance Smart Chain network, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties. </p><p> E. You are responsible for your MetaMask wallet (and other  Binance Smart Chain wallets) and the private key to access it. </p><p> F. The LiL Moon Rockets are digital art works and serve no other purpose other than that of an art work. The Name Your Rocket Token serves only one purpose: to change the name of your NFT on-chain. </p><h2>2. PAYMENT</h2><p> A. If you decide to purchase a LiL Moon Rocket digital art portrait from the contract, any financial transactions will be conducted solely through the Binance Smart Chain network. We have no control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, the company will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Binance Smart Chain network. </p><p> B.  Binance Smart Chain requires the payment of a transaction fee (a ‚ÄúGas Fee‚Äù) for every transaction that occurs on the Binance Smart Chain network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Binance Smart Chain network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App. The Gas Fee does not go to us and we have no control over its pricing. </p><p> D.

Upgrades by  Binance Smart Chain to the  Binance Smart Chain platform, a hard fork in the  Binance Smart Chain platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the  Binance Smart Chain platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-721 standard, including the LiL Moon Rockets ecosystem. </p><h2>6.
